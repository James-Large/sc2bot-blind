# sc2bot-blind
Start of an AI for playing Starcraft 2 using the python API

SC2 was my goto competitive game for a while, going from bronze to high master in WoL and playing a little HotS too. I still watch GSL and play monobattles every now and then, might play some ladder at some point too. bLind was my old handle, long story on that one. I'm currently studying for a PhD in machine learning at UEA, but am not focusing on deep learning of any kind really. This project is intended to keep me practiced in python, which I rarely use day-to-day, and get me using some kind of DL in an actually interesting application to me.

To start with, I'll be drawing heavily from sentdex's tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3LJ6VvpfgI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcT3tPehHdisGMc8TInNqdq
